If you're struggling in this class:
* Contact Shelley and/or me!
  * Shelley is the Sheriff. Extensions and extra absences go through her.
  * If you need to miss a discussion session, make sure to let me know.]

If you're struggling in general:
* Drop into my open office hours or schedule an appointment. I will help connect you to campus resources.
  * Remember that I am a mandatory reporter. If you need to talk about something confidentially, just tell me you would like to speak to a confidential resource and I will give you information on how to contact them.]
